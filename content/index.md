Hello there! My name's Christine and I do some engineering, particularly electrical and electronics.

This is my personal blog and website I use to share [projects I am working on](Projects%20List.md), [thoughts](Thoughts%20Preamble.md) and [other personal content](Personal%20Content%20List.md) I would like to share.

I also put the [neat stuff](Neat%20Index.md) I found here as well to not forget I found that said neat thing and for others to also see that neat thing.

I hope you enjoy taking a sleuthing around my blog. This isn't much, but it's mine.
