# Preamble

One part of multiple automated gardening systems hobbyist projects has always irked and annoyed me - none of them are reliable or controlling enough to leave them alone to the elements to tend to your crops.

Leaving behind the plants at the flat, coming back later than expected and seeing them all dead already. Never really trusting the pumping and dripping machines to be left alone, as many times it has behaved funnily or something loosening up and being a rude wet awakening on the floor.

## Constraints

This project is take along the rabbit hole of attempting a system to follow the specific constraints

- It can be left alone with no human touch or configuration for at least 3 months.

- It can adapt towards the increasing demand of the plant and potential issues such as disease or lack of water.

-  It doesn't require extremely specific tools and parts besides sensors, microcontroller(s) and basic screwdriver to build it.

- (Optional) It can harvest the said fruits of the labour.
